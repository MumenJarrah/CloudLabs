# Lab 1 - Basic Linux Commands

## Lab overview

In this lab, we are going to overview basic Linux commands for extracting information about the machine we are using, main file system operations, and basics of editing a file.

All the commands will be run using the command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a powerful tool for running applications, inspecting the system status, and configuring a machine.

First, open a terminal application. Click on the terminal application on the desktop.

The terminal opens showing the shell prompt as shown below. The shell allows running commands and applications.

To run a command, type a command in the shell and press Enter. For instance, type `date` in the shell and press Enter. This runs the date command and displays the date and time of the machine.

## Run the `date` command

```bash
date
```

## 1. Finding help related to a command

For any given command, you can use the `man` command to print the command manual. For instance:

```bash
man su
```
